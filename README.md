# azure-tomcat-pipeline 
This project demonstrates a simple Azure Pipelines setup to deploy a WAR file to a Tomcat server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) account.
- Access to a Tomcat server with the Manager App installed.
- Tomcat server details (URL, username, and password).
- The WAR file of your application.

## Setup

1. **Azure Pipelines Configuration:**

   - Fork/Clone this repository.
   - Set up a new pipeline in Azure Pipelines, and connect it to your fork/clone.

2. **Configure Pipeline Variables:**

   Update the pipeline variables in the Azure Pipelines YAML file (`azure-pipelines.yml`):
   
   ```yaml
   variables:
     tomcatUrl: 'http://your-tomcat-server:8080'
     tomcatUsername: 'your-tomcat-username'
     tomcatPassword: 'your-tomcat-password'
     warFileName: 'your-app.war'

## Run the Pipeline:

Trigger the pipeline manually or on a specific branch to deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat server.

## Security Considerations
### Credentials:

Avoid hardcoding credentials in the YAML file. Use Service Connections or Variable Groups to securely store sensitive information.
### Tomcat Manager App:

Ensure that your Tomcat server has the Manager App installed and configured for remote deployment.

## Additional Notes
This is a basic example. Modify the YAML file based on your project structure and requirements.
Always follow best practices for secure credential management in CI/CD pipelines.
